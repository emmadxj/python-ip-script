The Jenkins Job DSL is defined in the job groovy.
As one of the requirement, the job should be triggered from this repo as well. Therefore, there is additional setting in both Jenkins and Github side.

Jenkins:
Installed GitHub Integration Plugin is installed
Github access is allowed by setup in Manage Jenkins --> Manage tools configuration.
http://172.20.10.4:8080/ is the ip of my local jenkins instance.


Github:
Setup the GitHub Webhook, with which the jenkins job will be triggered on a Push event.

Refer to below console output. When a test file is commited, a jenkins job is auto triggered.
